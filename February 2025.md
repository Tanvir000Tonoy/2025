It's friday and I'm planning something crazy . I want to go out with Tania. Even though she don't like me. Still I don't wanna miss that opportuinity. If my dad allows me to take his car , it would turned out a very good experience as we will not feel glitchy or the warm weather might not effect us. Else I'm just doing the boring stuff. If my dad dosen't allow me to take the car then I might cancel the plan for sure.

I have few hours now. So be very careful Tonoy. No more procastination. You have a long time to pass be selfish. Be strong. Be the best version of yourself. From Tomorrow only focus on the immigration and landing parts. Do a lot of research about flights. 

[17.02.2025]
Be polite with each person and relative. Collect as many memories as you can (in any form). Today is Fariya's birthday, so wish her good luck. You did not sleep properly, so take short naps whenever you get time. Don't waste time on the internet. Go outside and talk with people; who knows who will be absent when you are present next? Today, Tania posted a story where she was holding your diary and a flower, and the song she added to the story was:

"tomake chhowar nei tw amar shaddho , dekhte pawa shei tw boro vhaggo" - WOW 

[18.02.2025]
Today is my flight. I don't know what is going to happen. FI AMANILLAH - Tonoy ...

Today was an exciting day. I did a lot of things. In the morning I visited Southern Cross Train Station with COstas, He drived there for me. Later I meet with Rakibul Hasan Vhaiya and he handed over me my driving licence. Afterwards we visited the CQ university Melbourne for rakibul vhaiya's Enrollment. And later We got into the metro but missed the burnley station so we had to walk for 40 minutes to reach my university and oh god It was the best walk I ever had in AUSTRALIA. I just loved the process. After reaching there they offered free lunch. It was a vageterian dish. After taking the meal I left Rakibul vaiya to the Glenferry Station and straightly head towards to my course induction ceremony in ATC Buildring. it was like ATC 101 - ATC 316. The Prof. Man HUng was leading us. AT the end i arrived at my current resident with few gifts from swinburne .
Those are :
1. Diary 
2. A Small Mug 
3. Few more bags

[28.02.2025]
Today was our discovery day and I enjoyed a lot. In the morning I went to swinburne university of technoloyg with one of my home mate called Tanvir SHuvo. I enjoyed a lot with the fastive environment. I don't know what to expect from that university but it is really something out of my mind. I'm hopeful , optimistic about the future. I'm afried about tomorrow. The ramadan is going to commence but I don't know how I will pass this month. I have a lot of things to do. whatever. Today was fun. I did shopping , also purchased a new airbuds type c and it's really good product. later I also did the zumma namaz. But I'm not feeling happy though I'll bypass this feeling by learning something meaningful
