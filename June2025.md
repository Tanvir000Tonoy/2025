# I'm alive #

I am learning assembly language but not in a healthy pace. I don't know I'm feeling so tired. I need some sleep, doing assingments continously in this pace is really hard. Then I fall into asleep. Later Nothing was finished no submission had been made by me. I switched to mathematics assignments. Used little bit of AI to get into the track.

Random thoughts keep swirling in my mind. I wonder what life would be like if I weren't hereâ€”maybe spending more time with my parents, celebrating every occasion together. Perhaps I could have excelled at UIU, become a top student, or been the best friend in my circle. Right now, though, I just don't feel well.

Planning for the upcoming days. All devices should be used by maintianing a proper ambition. I will use my iPhone 15 PM only for earning purpose. Like doing uber managing finance for example banking and making payments. iPad will be only for educational purpose, for instance reading regularly offshore books like `think and grow rich` , `big book of small project` bla bla bla . Macbook will be used for Entertainment and Education but mostly for development (creating and learning). Pixel 9a will be like a device that will be used for communication and entertainment. I will use all the social media apps on that phone alongside watching netflix,Amazon Prime and so on. I will store all my future photos and videos [less videos because it cuts off chunk of storage]  into my iPhone as its camera is comparatively sophisticated.
