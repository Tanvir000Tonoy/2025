Today I will try my best to sleep properly and learn something meaningful like Python or R. Whatsoever I'm doing great. Got the visa but an uncertainity is killing me. How I will do work there like I have no experiences. I do know how to operate cars or any computer regaring task but I'm not used to do any of them . :) Oh God Please save me ! 
Todays Agenda : 
1. Create a repo on Python and R 
2. wake up soon, before 10 
3. Try to do some exercises like push ups and burpy
